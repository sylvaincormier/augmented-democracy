\section{Abstract}

\paragraph{Introduction}
\subparagraph{}


Continuing world conflicts, environmental and economical issues, 
unnecessary human suffering combined with questionable electoral 
processes have rendered voters cynical of institutions.
Furthermore, the decisions needed to be taken by these institutions as a humanity 
and the speed at which these decisions 
need to be taken are not consequent with the severity 
of the adversity many species and ecosystems are facing. 
Restoring confidence in individuals by extending their responsibilities
beyond voting for a candidate 
will provide the system with necessary input 
to regulate exchanges via software framework 
for managing human interactions concerning society's vital systems. 
For this, an individual must be granted the freedom to choose  their level of involvement, 
the type of involvement they want to partake in
and the level of privacy they want for a particular transaction.

On the other hand, the system itself must entirely be open source as well as 
transparent to regulated levels specified.
Block chains will provide guaranteed sequential knowledge by 
certifying transactions while allowing different levels of 
privacy even up to anonymity.

This will not only improve efficiency but will also ensure decorum and fairness.
The amount of data processing required to enhance managent 
of all humanity's issues is already available and
the emergence of a system capable of addressing the endless 
processes of our complex world will eventually emerge. 
Reaching this goal will be humanity's most tedious task.
Until then, mandatory public implication in the form of choosing questions for polls, 
testing one's knowledge on a poll and engaging in polls can already contribute 
to such a system by the contribution of the poll test grids provided by the system.    
The poll test grids are gathered by humans who mechanically contribute to assert granular facts.

A whole societal framework can be built upon simple instructions, concepts rules and laws.
This document proposes a societal model where actors intervene within a 
software framework that  gathers, sorts, validates, 
polls certified and anonymous opinions to eventually publish humanity's data so better decisions can be made. 
This system should eventually influence officials to take account of a logical chains, educated public opinions and interventions, 
simulations, efficient calendar issues therefore dissolving any cynicism and enhancing the experience and quality of individual contribution.
The end goal of the framework is is to maximize efficiency towards homeostasis of humanity within systems and as a shell to other systems.
The making of an organic decision instance into a functional self regulating system demands that basic rules be respected.
These rules can initially be determined by any means. These rules will and should subsequently be verified by the system 
itself and the people interacting with it always.
Technology, individuals and officials should all abide by design not only towards efficiency but towards intelligence
by making communication more accurate, always available, questionable and modifiable.

Enter an era of total transparency and open source functionality.
An inconvenient truth for many, but justice for all.
A more efficient and just system can be built over the present system in the following ways:
- An individual's basic contribution to the system obligatory but the means to do this is entirely up to the individual. 
- Educating individuals to subsequently get their opinionvia polls created by these same citizens. 
- Record and publish every civil servants, officials and government's transactions and decisions in a ledger. 
- Build an open source operating system which manages votes, government transactions according to a timeline.
- Allow individuals and companies to invest in issues, questions or bids.
This project cannot without intense participation and people on their own will
most likely not at first realize the power put at their disposal.
This is why it must first be implemented at the heart of government policy.
This document is putting forward a concept which by its essential framework polling rules
can debate other complementary ideas put forward in this document.
The distilled rules are obligatory tested polling with mandatory user involvement,
open source policy with obligatory merging of  framework nodes and indiscriminate 
publishing of results and blockchain validation of transactions.
Institutions in this document are: Entities or corporations, Individuals, Officials and 
the Operating system

\subparagraph{}\

\paragraph{Individuals}
\subparagraph{functions}\
\begin{enumerate}	
\item		Create questions
\subparagraph{}\
An individual can create a question concerning a social issue that is he or she is concerned with. 
This can be as general a question concerning a law that exists or should exist 
or as granular as the allocation of a government contract. 
These questions are then voted on to suggest the proper course of action to be taken by officials.
\item	Create evaluation grids and tests for enabling contributors 
to vote on questions, issues or transactions involving bureaucracy.
\subparagraph{}\
Before someone is allowed to vote on a particular question, 
a test needs to be taken to prove the voter is at least conscious 
of established facts surrounding the question.
\item	Link or assign scientific papers or media to questions 
\subparagraph{}\
Scientific papers, media and links to articles can be attached to the evaluation grid that will be used.
\item	Act as a mechanical human*
\subparagraph{}\
* A mechanical human is a term derived from the derogatory "mechanical turk".
Basic human behaviour or interactions concerning specific issues 
is needed for deep learning or artificial intelligence engines. 
Also, certain mundane tasks cannot yet be calculated by machine 
and can only be done by humans. 
These simple tasks will allow individuals with less intellectual capability or less will to help to 
still fulfill the amount of work to allow the basic universal income or even be compensated if desired.
\item	Take tests to be enabled to vote on government contracts allocation, questions and issues
\subparagraph{}\		
\item	Invest money in questions of interest
\subparagraph{}\
If an individual feels that a question is of greater importance and deserves more allocated resources than the operating system has decided,
he or she can contribute financial resources so the system can assign more people to work on that particular question.
\item	Contribute to operating system codebase
\subparagraph{}\
The system's functionality resides in its core or kernel. 
This needs to be created and maintained by architects, designers, programmers and testers.
\item	Elect officials
\subparagraph{}\
Officials need to be elected as in the existing system.
\item	Maintain infrastructures 
\subparagraph{}\
\item	Publish immediate material needs.
\subparagraph{}\
The amount of resource needed by each individual can be voluntarily disclosed to corporation 
for more efficient ressource management.
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph {Areas of responsibility}

\begin{enumerate}

\item	The area of responsibility of the individual is global and
is subject to existing laws and system.
\subparagraph{}\
Individuals have the responsibility to contribute to the system to a comfortable minimum by law.
\item	Except for in a possible anonymous mode, from which important opinions can be gathered,
the individual should be accountable to voting against approved and documented facts.
\subparagraph{}\
All information is open and available to all. Individuals that deliberately ignore established facts
should be known and advertised as such. Special means can then be allocated 
to understand the situation.
\item	Individuals are responsible for the projects they contributed to.
\subparagraph{}\
All information about is recorded and kept. An individual's contribution to a project is known
regardless of positive or negative outcome.
\item	Individuals can contribute to any project.
\subparagraph{}\
There are no restrictions in the choice of the individual with regards to the contributions they want to make.
There is total freedom. 
\item	Salary is calculated according to each and every one's capacity of contribution.
\subparagraph{}\
Not everyone is capable of contributing or wishes to contribute in the same manner.
For this, different types of task, differing in complexity or tediousness can be achieved.
Also, handicap, or responsibilities as a caretaker are examples of factors which can influence the capacity of contribution. 
The system will determine adequate compensation for each task. Of course, revision of this compensation can be argued through the same process
as any question that is run through the system: Question->grid->test->Vote. 
The capacity of contribution can be evaluated according to a weighing environmental, physical, psychological or any other factor which
could influence the amount of successful transactions generated per unit of time.	 
\item	Each transaction has an impact factor.
\subparagraph{}\
 This is a measurement or index calculated by the system in which the transaction's impact is which is weighed according to environmental, social, political, financial  		
or any other factor which could influence or promote the amount of progress in wealth, health and well being of the population and its environment or in its stability.
This index is dynamic and can initially be calculated according to predictions and subsequently according to results.
\item	Contribution to operating system is mandatory 
\subparagraph{}\
 The minimal amount of contribution is calculated according to individual capacity of contribution.
The system is in essence fair and will not coerce anyone to contribute against their will.
This is why the capacity of contribution also includes one's will to contribute as a factor.
An individual will be required to contribute an absolute minimum to be determined. 
For gravely disabled or elderly, this contribution could be symbolic.
In order to determine the capacity of contribution and the minimum required contribution, a grid will have to initially be put forward by
all institutions. Eventually the system can take over and determine this from calculations based on experience.  
\item	Contribution to the operating system ensures the availability of social benefits.
\subparagraph{}\
In order to benefit from the basic social safety net, for example, healthcare or basic universal income, individuals must satisfy the minimal required contribution.

\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph {benefits}
\begin{enumerate}	
\item	Individuals get paid for any work they do for the system.
\subparagraph{}
The amount vary according to the system's resources, and the priority that is assigned to that job. 
\item	Individuals can apply deductions to money they owe the government.
\subparagraph{}
An individual can deduce things like taxes, parking tickets. 
\item	Individuals can be entitled to ?accomplishment? bonus according to the level of contribution to the operating system or by its measured effects.
\subparagraph{}		
\item	Social privileges and advantages. 
\subparagraph{}
Individuals can be entitled can be to social privileges and advantages according to their level of 
contribution to the operating system or by its measured effects.		
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Officials}
\subparagraph{Functions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item	Elected officials executes all functions of present day officials.
\subparagraph{}
As a civil servant or politician, the official uses the knowledge provided by the machine to perform his functions or translates operating system results into applicable laws.
\item Addresses and mediates with bodies of population who voted against documented facts.
\subparagraph{}
Officials promote fairness and try to find solutions to unsatisfied individuals or groups that may find themselves victims of certain decisions.
\item Motivator, public figure at ceremonies.
\subparagraph{}
Officials inspire Individuals and corporations to get involved and contribute in harmony.
They are the ones to preside at inaugurations, commemorations and any public function.
\item	Law enforcement. 
Officials as today, physically enforce the system. 
They are subject to entities and individuals through their suggestions by the operating system.
The courses of action suggested b y the system is meant to provide an environment where a pertinent claim will obtain, 
in the fastest possible delay and with most financial and ethical value, the best possible outcome for all entities.
Officers infringe on their duty by not respecting the promotion of this goal. 
Any institution has a responsibility to uphold the law.
An institution can uphold the law through the system only.
The system is meant to provide an environment where a pertinent claim will obtain, 
in the fastest possible delay and with most financial and ethical value, the best possible outcome.
\item Validate and certify block chain ledger.
\subparagraph{}
The blockchain used to certify transactions is part of the system core.
 The system cannot fork because one instance is final. 
Although the system can sustain the most dramatic changes in its core, 
again, the system cannot fork because of the introduction of factions 
which defeats the purpose of conducting strict fact evaluation 
according to sometimes conventions but ideally previously proven results.
\item Official as a kill switch.
The function of an official should become a safeguard to the counsel given by the system and the impact thereof.
Artificial intelligence and in a lesser manner, deep and machine learning have been foreseen as
disruptive and potentially dangerous by leading, present day industrials.
Efficiency gained by operating system insights is acknowledge and applied by officials. 

\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Areas of responsibility}
\begin{enumerate}
\item	The area of area of responsibility of the Official is to existing laws and system.
Officials obey as well as enforce existing laws .
Officials manage situations by enforcing the law according to operating system insights.
\subparagraph{}
Officials pass laws according to their respective countries's existing laws but eventually according to operating system information.
The official has the same responsibilities as today but transparency is increased and undebatable information is readily available for individuals to use
in day to day interactions but also can be used against them in the case of abuse of power.  
In this sense, officials are accountable to the information provided by the operating system. 
\item	Promote ethics.
\subparagraph{}
The operating system calculates optimal decisions for the officials to take for making society more efficient and just.
The officials are responsible for for following the most effective but humane course of action by using the counselling
power of the system.   
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Benefits}
\begin{enumerate}
\item	Salary.
\subparagraph{}
Salary for officials should be above average to underline prestige that comes with the responsibility. 
\item	Public recognition.
\subparagraph{}
Officials should be exemplary examples of good conduct and for this, public recognition
is important. Individuals will know that because of the operating system, the will and personality of officials is genuine.
The faults will be exposed and their term ended should they trespass.
\item	Simplified tasks.
If an official wishes, he or she can just express the will of the system and 
oversee for anomalies while performing their automated task.
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{Entities or corporations}
\subparagraph{Functions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Can but is not obligated to finance bid contests and questions by injecting money into operating system.
\subparagraph{}
The bureaucratic process has always been know to be lengthy and officials have been known illegally accept bribes to ensure 
or speed up government contracts.
Allowing institutions or corporations to inject money into a question of their interest can at least speed up bureaucracy and promote fairness.
Individuals involved with the corporation can also contribute to the test and grid.
Nevertheless, if anyone disagrees with the way the process is conducted at this level, a question can always be created to expose and rectify any unjust procedure.
Leftover money, if any, is reinjected into the system to finance other operations.

\item	Hires workers and contractors enabling them with a salary.
\subparagraph{}
As in present day, companies hire workers to enable them with capital.
\item	Contributes to operating system development or maintenance.
\subparagraph{}
As with the present day open source community, a company can contribute to open source code that they can use and that can then revised
for integration into the kernel by the strict procedure of the machine itself.
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{area of  area of responsibility}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The area of responsibility of entities is global.
The area of of responsibility of the Official is to existing laws and system.
All entities are responsible within their share of influence.
An entity or corporation's influence is environmental and nature, operating system health and infrastructure, economic and individual health.
\item	Entities like all other entities, are accountable to the information provided by the operating system.
\item	Entities are like today, accountable to officials and the laws of the countries they are conducting business in.
\item Innovation, marketing and knowledge. 
\subparagraph{}
Entities drive development by generating capital, promoting and using knowledge.
Intellectual property should most likely distributed as open source 
once a determined, useful capital has been generated from it. 
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Benefits}
\begin{enumerate}	
\item Direct consumer base
\subparagraph{}
Part of the demand and where it comes from is known in realtime.
Companies can cater to these needs more efficiently by concentrating their efforts 
on offering the best product or service to individuals and officials.
\item Advertising by direct cause promotion, public recognition.
Campaigns concerning or sometime associated by sponsoring certain issues are encouraged as they will generate enthusiasm 
associated to a brand which will most likely later translates into capital.
\item Influence speed of bid processing by financing issues
Companies can promote efficiency and cost reduction by reducing delays.
\end{enumerate}
		
\paragraph{Operating system}
\subparagraph{functions}\

\begin{enumerate}
\item	 Provide an efficient but comfortable system or framework for the collaboration of officials, 
entities and individuals
The fabric of a society (social fabric) or system is its basic structure, 
with all the customs and beliefs that make it work successfully.
A "social tissue" is on the other hand a biological representation of the constantly acting 
mechanisms of society. The operating system will help this "social tissue" reach homeostasis 
by regulating interactions, polling, scheduling tasks and publishing validations.
In this manner, any law and its application can be subject to evaluation by polling of enabled individuals or by research
done by the system. 
The constant reinjection of data because of new events in the system
and enabled individuals inputs will lessen the the anthropocentric treatment 
of data in the formulation of laws or their applications.
  
Laws should also evolve constantly just as a living organism addressing its needs
must rapidly modify the way it reacts to each stimulus given by its environment.
The system uses habitual voting performed by informed and educated people for decision making. 
Subsequently these results can be used as input to AI and deep learning,
The consensus gentium and machine intelligence will build on each other 
to suggest will give the best scenario. 

\item	 Anonymous mode
\subparagraph{}\
In order to entice certain collaborations, an anonymous mode should be provided.
Results are then compared and weighed according to their counterparts which are tied to specific users.
Certain restrictions could apply for this mode. for instance the ability to obtain tax credits or compensation, 
as for the identity of the person is not known. 
As with digital currency, the identity of these transactions can remain unknown but are devalued in the priority
their situation incur because they have to be ultimately be seen and reviewed by officials and known individuals.
Corporations cannot operate in anonymous mode.
An anonymous mode is to be provided for comparative and potentially useful input from individuals. 
Certain restrictions to be determined to apply to transactions, especially for 
kernel based or core transactions.
\item	 Autonomy and broadcast
\subparagraph{}\
Nodes of the system need to merge at any cost because forks are not allowed.
This means that nodes seek each other above all.
For this the constantly emit the address at which they will receive transactions and constantly poll 
for the latest version.
In anonymous mode, an onion based router can be used.
\item Manage user profiles
\subparagraph{}\
Centralized mandatory information on users is needed for the governmental needs of officers.
Entities may only get individual's commercial reception address.
The user subsequently has an automated, private filtering mechanism for what he or she wants to see.
\item Gather and merge questions through semantic analysis.
\subparagraph{}\
\item Gather tests/grids.
\subparagraph{}\
\item Conduct question.
\subparagraph{}\
\item Conduct test/grid evaluation.
\subparagraph{}\
Provide a forum where people can contribute to test grids in real-time.
\item Gather papers from which to derive questions for test.
\subparagraph{}\
\item Gather media from which to derive questions for test.
\subparagraph{}\
\item Manage evaluation system.
\subparagraph{}\
\item Store and back up data redundantly.
\subparagraph{}\
\item Schedule transactions.
\subparagraph{}\
\item Provide an efficient and practical interface for queries and searches.
Ergonomically design user input to maximize interaction. 
\subparagraph{}\
\item Display comprehensible, convincing and useful metrics.
\subparagraph{}\
Constantly suggest different ways of expressing the concerned data 
as to cater to as many individuals as possible whilst strictly not modifying content.
\item Manage news feed. 
\subparagraph{}\
Publish most urgent feed first and market implication for these issues.
Offer an intelligent filtering system.
\item Offer hypothetical scenarios and probabilities. 
\subparagraph{}\
Running of simulations are essential for core functionality but can also be extended
towards predictive technology for better management of outcomes.
\item Calculates individual work remuneration benefits and privileges.
This task remuneration is calculated according to capacity of contribution and impact factor.
\subparagraph{}\
\item Peer reviewing mechanism for proof other than papers and media. 
\subparagraph{}\
Ultimately, a certified system of corroboration which subsequently works in accordance to the operating system
will have to be put in place.
\item Manages and schedules the election of officials by individuals.
\subparagraph{}\
Today's electronic vote is no different than this except for the more transparent, 
non discriminant approach and ease of access the system could deliver.
\item Provides documentation to its internal workings, core or kernel and facilitates and should promote comprehension inherently by simplicity of design.
\subparagraph{}\
Constant re-architecture is possible but will be a constant challenge as the operating system is infinitely complex.
But over time and with much effort, results should entice institutions to embrace the new system. 
\subparagraph{}\
\item Determines impact factor.
\subparagraph{}\
The impact factor is determined according to the level of importance of a vote 
pertaining to the preservation of life, environment, equality, progress, economy, resources, well being.
\item Create job and resources board.
The system advertises available work but more intensely markets according to urgent needs 
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Areas of responsability}
	
\begin{enumerate}
\item Keep all source code of the operating system open.
\subparagraph{}\
All institutions need to have access to the latest 
stable essential core or kernel functions code at all times.
Make sure code is visible and that access and that the possibility of modifying the core 
through the due system procedure is granted to all.
\item Universal but safe user access.
\subparagraph{}\
The operating system should provide for equal use by all without bias.
Physically or mentally challenged individuals are provided adequate interfaces which 
enable them to attain the highest capacity of contribution.
\item Entice and allow for increasing quantity and quality of user input.
\subparagraph{}\
\item Validate individuals.
\subparagraph{}\
Submit user permitted user informations to officials.
\item Validate transactions.
\subparagraph{}\
Submit user permitted transaction informations to officials.
\item Interaction with existing legal system.
\subparagraph{}\
Officials snapshots of operating system sections could be accepted as evidence  
\end{enumerate}
			
\subparagraph{Benefits to society}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Useful, insightful organized information by the means of retrieval of facts and opinions, 
computer analysis and broadcast of resulting information as 
a result of the collaboration of entities.
\subparagraph{}\
A machine controlled and regulated environment for societal collaboration. 
\item Applicable data, ready for interfacing with technologies.
\subparagraph{}\
Limitless experience in a library of previously handled situations.
Available in a multitude of formats and languages.
\item The operating system has no decisive power.
\subparagraph{}\
As long as there is no certitude that artificial intelligence could never pos a threat to humanity, humanity remains the kill switch.
Humans make and enforce government and laws but with the help of the operating system.
\item Rational, non biased data analysis and suggested course of action.
\subparagraph{}\
Reassuring course of action based on facts.
Operating system empowers all entities with situations of truth.
\item Operating system should eliminate the need for cheating
\end{enumerate}

\section{Regulations}
\subparagraph{General policy}

\begin{enumerate}	
\item		The operating system runs along the present political system and is intended to serve as an accurate and official output of people's 	
advocacy as well unbiased data output from the system's analysis, but never as a decision making instance.
\item 	Individual participation to the operating system is mandatory.
\subparagraph{}
There should be a minimal contribution age or age as a factor in the contribution factor.
\item Officials have to gain extensive knowledge of operating system data collection, votes, studies, simulations and outputs in order to pass laws.
\subparagraph{}
\item Entities and individuals can contribute money or resources more generally to a question, call for bids but more specifically to any other form of transaction.
\subparagraph{}
This regulation can fast track the situation in itself for interested parties as
monies can be contributed towards the augmentation of resources working on a particular question, issue or call for bid.
\item A node in the system cannot be ignored.
\item All physical machines must be allowed to communicate.
\subparagraph{}
To maximize chances of long term system success and to dissolve any inequalities or hijacking of the system, merging of all nodes is mandatory, there can exist no branching.
\item Everything in the system can be voted on and reviewed.
\subparagraph{}
The open source distributed approach to the system allows for this. There can be no exceptions or restrictions.
\item Information about operating system output and and the concerned passed laws is broadcasted 
and can freely be discussed on dedicated parallel forums.
\subparagraph{}
The lack of synchronization between laws and system output indicate concerned officials are not in tune with logic or the will of the individuals and corporations.
They should be removed from office as soon as the system permits with scheduled election or removal from office with due procedure.
\item Operations validated with blockchain implementation.
\subparagraph{}
All operations are inserted in a node based ledger and can be consulted by anyone.
\item Operating system transactions cannot be blocked by purposely isolating devices.
\subparagraph{}
The system thrives on user input and restraining natural fluid propagation of information 
impedes the system and could signal abuse.
\item The calculated incidence or consequence of modifications to the operating system, bid selection our question result		
must be made public and advertised.
\subparagraph{}
Entities can query the system about possible outcome according to existing facts but also advised on likely scenarios.
\item Entities vote on important system modifications.
\subparagraph{}
All three entities must represent the vote in a percentage determined by the machine. 
Matching individual participation to industry investment in the hopes of balance will be a challenge, and official, much less represented, 
will help mediate to see this through.  
\item Violent, intimidating content is to be removed and its authors sanctioned.
\subparagraph{}
\item Anyone caught trying to hack the system in their favour will be prevented from voting and only allowed to work as a "mechanical human"
\subparagraph{}
\subparagraph{}
 \end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Official policy}
\begin{enumerate}		
\item Laws are made as in present day by elected officials.
\item Officials base their decision on operating system output and practical diplomacy.
\item Officials enforce individual and entity contribution to the operating system.
\item Officials enforce, ensure and certify operating system function.
\item All decisions must be taken in accordance to existing government protocol.
\item Flag irregularities.
 \end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Individual policy}
\begin{enumerate}		
\item Elects officials.	
\item Contributes to operating system.
\item Choses how he/she contributes to operating system.
\item Call for operating system modification. 
\item Flag irregularities.
\item Vote on questions and call for bids.
\item Vote on operating system modifications.
\item Vote on test grid elements validity.
\item Vote on question formulation amendment.
\item Publish needs.
\end{enumerate}
 
\subparagraph{Entity policy}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Contributes to operating system with financial means for physical infrastructure.
\item Flag irregularities.
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Operating system policy}		
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Operating system flags irregularities without discrimination.
\item  Operating system confronts officials with hard truth and informed public opinion.
\item Arranges vote for operating system modification if question is asked.
\item Calculates remuneration.
\item Defines priorities.
\item Conducts simulations.
\item Conducts votes.
\item Flags irregularities and ethics concerns.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Core Values}

	A social structure is essential to society's cohesion.
	Blind patriotism or charisma based politics have no 
	pertinence in face of the global challenges we face. 
	Our methods should be relying on knowledge, data organized
	by engineered systems.
	The proposed system is totally transparent and accessible but every operation on the system is recorded.
	The operating system allows individuals to change anything they believe is wrong 
	or unjust with the system and obtain positive change in a reasonable lapse of time.
	In this model, individuals become the solution by contribution where they want, how they want and how much they want. 
	To promote the respect of equality between humans, such a system could certainly be of help.

	The information used to render justice has been validated, corroborated, recorded and published.
	This is why the operating system should ensure that information gathered concerning decisions by government 
	and the official's final decision in passing a law, facts, simulations and analysis would be part of a blockchain
	where all decisions are accountable.
	This accountability, for practical purposes, can start as being demonstrative.
	An elected official would not be held accountable but his popularity would then fail hime or her for obvious reasons.
	
	A Source of income / guaranteed base salary ensures that all parts of the system are functional on a biological level.
	For this, everyone is equal in the face of the operating system. 
	To help pay for costs, there must be mandatory contribution from everyone. 
	Not everyone has the same capacity of contribution of physical, psychological, emotional, environmental etc.. factors.
	The system provides a way to calculate a proportional rule where the obligations and remunerations of everyone is adjusted
	to their situation.
	The Operating system requires all types of contributions to match these various abilities, from "mechanical human" to system architect.
	he Operating system must be open source and must provide documentation describing its functions.
	The complexity of the operating system and its data, should be comparable to the complexity of financial systems we have today. 
	One of the functions of the operating system is to provide universal access. 
	This stretches beyond providing interfaces for physically and mentally challenged people or providing interaction in all languages. 
	It also must constantly be refactored and redesigned not only for the performance of its engine,
	but for also for the simplification of its design to democratize and promote as much as possible user involvement. 
	The would ideally eliminates the possibility to cynically criticize the system for being unchangeable.

\section{Descision making capacity}
		
	The government, Individuals and entities are subject to the operating system time and schedule.
	With the aid of mechanical humans, test grid makers, voters and programmers, 
	a cohesive and efficient entity emerges into powerful data analysis tool, 
	refining its processes and learning from past decisions and multiple other factors, 
	constantly redefining itself as nodes are merged.
	The operating system yields answers to questions such as a course of action, 
	helping to allocate resources and provide a suggested schedule.
	It has no power to make decisions.
	This coincides with issues being debated in government.
	Information about issues is renewed in real time.

	Biomimicry is humanity's more biocentric and less anthropocentric way of looking at systems.
	There are concepts which are so imminent in nature that to ignore them would 
	preposterous and somewhat pompous.    
	For instance, biological systems have cycles when certain physiological changes occur.
	Biological systems are programmed with adaptations to these physical events but also to 
	to other changes which are often unpredictable but more recurring.
	Could we perhaps transpose that in our "social tissue", for example? 
	The election of an official can come every four years and the decisions taken by this official can only come as fast as his bureaucracy.
	The operating system operates along side the government at tremendous speeds with information that will alleviate bureaucracy. 
	It will feed the government employees with the valuable data they need to prepare the officials to pass laws, faster. 
	Laws will one day be able to change more rapidly and dynamically, because of 
	almost instant knowledge and global consent.

\paragraph{Effectiveness}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Society as a machine.
\subparagraph{} 
Concepts are never better proven accurate as when they are programmed into a functional running system.
\item Open Source.
\subparagraph{}
It is easier to understand a system and diagnose its ailments if one has the whole picture.
All code and data available.
\item Distributed agreement protocol instead of proof of work 
\subparagraph{} Replace blocks with ledgers (Ripple blockchain)
\item Interactive proof assistants built into system mechanisms
\end{enumerate}
paragraph{Resources and financing}
The operating system is an economic system in itself.
\subparagraph{System currency value}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The total amount of work tied in to essential services
\item The total amount of money in the system
\item The amount of money owed by the system voluntary workers (Kickoff initial stage)
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Remuneration}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Level of permitted contribution is evaluated according to the the capacity of contribution and the urgency level of a question
\subparagraph{}
\end{enumerate}
 
 \paragraph{Effectiveness}
 Effectiveness in this system:

1. Optimal resource management
	From automated bureaucracy to waste disposal or crop estimation etc..
	
2. Detached decision system
	THe proposed system cannot be influenced by human behaviour.

3. Social catharsis
	Émile Durkheim: proposed emotional stages of social sharing.
	Through sharing, there is a reciprocal stimulation of emotions and emotional communion.
	This leads to social effects like social integration and strengthening of beliefs.
	Finally, individuals experience a renewed trust in life, strength, and self-confidence. 
The system acts as a scheduler for the endless amounts of transactions life has to offer.
It decides when a vote is to be conducted, the capacity of contribution and salary for individuals.
It can extend into bureaucracy to suggest a decision to the official. 
The system is regulated by distributed agreement protocol and ledger validation.
By its processes, it accumulates vast amounts of data to be used by bureaucracy in its daily administration.
A deferred, adjustable, sometimes directed workforce, pending to the needs of government  policy making and enforcement. 
Crowdfunding by corporate and individual contributions to specific questions is allowed.(Bidding on certain questions)
It gets resolved faster. 
The system hires as many people as it needs to address the issues that are submitted to it.
When the vote is done, money is reasonably distributed amongst contributers as a bonus for having resolved the issue within the operating system's
estimated completion time. 
The rest of the money is funnelled back into general system maintenance and design.
The publication of needs by individuals should help companies better manage their overhead,
steer their production in the most productive direction and better direct their advertising.

 \paragraph{Trust and insight}
The proposed system is a true reflection of an educated mass.
Over time, with experience, the system should be able to learn and 
will be able to deduce the proper course of action for successful future outcome.  
The operating system cannot gain bias by its interaction with the users,
it uses logic and is only meant to be influential with the information it delivers. 
A trustworthy and insightful system can be built upon a platform
that is always completely open, subject to peer review 
and unconditionally used by all citizens, corporations and politicians 
because it delivers truth. 
As hard to face as it might be, the most valuable insight 
will be to know the opinion of free and educated citizens, 
as a result of minimal implication.
Even if gathered opinion still diverges from facts,
this will be documented and analyzed to obtain, again in suggestive form, 
the most humane and efficient course of action. 
Mostly bearing witness to truth is the main goal of this system.

\paragraph{Flexibility}
The system can be installed on a device or computer.
It can report to a server or, by its nodal nature, work on its own.
Merging nodes augments entropy which later on crystallizes 
into recorded information through the process of human preference 
and computer logic.
 
A priority engine manages tasks and as in existing systems officials should, 
at least in the initial stages, circumvent transactions to allow more flexible manoeuvre.
The system should allow freedom to be experienced by individuals, totally.
Social obligations are to be perceived at the system level, 
not out of patriotism but out of the desire to preserve social cohesion just as accomplishing family chores to 
ensure family cohesion.

\paragraph{Protection against the abuse of power}

The open source model and block chain ensures complete and total transparency,
the first line of defence against centralized control.
Secondly, no one except for officials can be prevented from voting or contributing
or changing any irregular situation, thus ensuring a true egalitarian democracy.
Also, as long as an obligatory merge of all geographically separated machine instances is enforced, 
not one single body can gain control of the system.
Lastly, the system remains consultative, and any abuse of power perpetrated 
by officials will be no different the actual situation and cannot be prevented although
actions will be recorded and published.
Traditional elections will therefore be influenced by more truthful discourse
around questions and officials should assume more their role as public servants. 


\paragraph{Accountability}

Pending issues are prioritized by the system and the code 
for this mechanism can constantly be under revision and in permutation.
If issues are not taken into consideration by the elected officials,
the publication platform will advertise this taking into account priority 
and urgency and the official will publicly be held responsible.
 
 
\paragraph{General security}

The system is only for consultation. 
Wars, battles and disputes are conducted virtually 
by merging distributed instances of the operating system.
System operating functions are kernel based and isolated from user space.
Any modification of the kernel must undergo the with the same scrutiny, approval and testing
which is at the core of the system's ideology.
The system is meant to be an extension to the present system and cannot worsen 
general security of the existing system.
Officials are the keepers of the system, acting as a failsafe for any mismanagement
artificial intelligence or any other anomaly could bring.
Again, the security of the present day banking system is proff that this is possible.


\section{Conclusion}

This is a system where everyone can feel they have the power to change things,
where the question at hand and issues are more important than the political party.
The degree of severity of issues will be determined according to the inner workings
of the system instead of human opinion. 
The system will start evolving by being programmed, then by means of user input, 
then by user input validation, and the publication of results for all to see, especially elected officials.
This should modify the discourse and manner working of politicians.
Most people today feel the voting process is just not serving them.
Getting rid of the present system seems impossible, but implementing this voting and polling system as 
a logical and reliable oracle seems more plausible. 	
Today, even if a politician decides he wants to make a difference, he or she has to waddle through
a mess of lobby pressure and adhere to the party line. 
The voter is left powerless to see his world and the world he foresees for his children be disgracefully manhandled. 
This system eliminates the cynicism one can feel towards the system by giving everyone direct access to democracy 
at anytime, with the level of implication they want.
This system could also eliminate corruption entirely by allowing the flow of capital from private interests 
to fund questions instead of the political party.
Enter the era of a world ruled by a social media platform for collecting input from citizens concerning social and political choices, 
government tenders and any other situation where transparency is preferred.
With the help of AI and deep learning, this system will not only speed up the implementation of regulations but allow for constant 
modifications and updates to be made not unlike any organic body, a real social tissue.
This system should consists of a familiar, easy to use interface where users can posts questions, modify existing questions, 
vote on question formulation, vote on a question after having taken a test verifying they know hard facts,
 and invest money in a particular question if they wish. 
The transactions are validated using blockchain ledger and agglomerated using code versioning systems. 
The open source operating system on which it is built is also to be managed in the same fashion with anybody being able to view the processes and contribute if he or she wishes.
A major safeguard is put in place in the sense that a vote on a question must be backed by a test the user passed,  proving he or she knows the main facts concerning this issue. 
Voted in the same manner which consists of facts, this test is made of a grid which consists of links, papers, studies etc.. which carry a specific weight.
This system also aims at dissolving the issues surrounding corruption and bribing of public officials directly by allowing anyone to invest money in particular questions of their interest. 
This will influence the speed at which this question will be treated but will never influence the result of the question itself. 
This money is then used to pay contributors to this question, contributors to tests grids or programmers or administrators of the system.
The biggest challenge with most systems is incentive, which is why this part is central to proposed policy.
Instead of forcing individuals to contribute, providing incentive centered design of a familiar and practical interface along with 
contagious social momentum, effective results in changing policy, transparency, financial retribution 
and government refunds are all ways to make this system more appealing to all.
